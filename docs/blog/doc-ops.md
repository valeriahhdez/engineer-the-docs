# DocOps, docs-as-code, and docs engineers: Or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the pipeline

As I was knee-deep in Docker containers, GitHub Actions, and the thrilling mystery of ‚Äúwhy won't this deploy,‚Äù I realized I still didn¬°t fully understand how documentation engineering, Docs-as-Code, and DocOps all fit together (or what skills I could build on as a technical writer expanding into a more technical role). So, I did some non-exhaustive research (read: fell down several documentation rabbit holes), had several philosophical chats with ChatGPT, and voil√†: here are my notes, cleaned up just enough to share with future me‚Ä¶ and now, with you.

## What is DocOps?

DocOps (Documentation Operations) is a methodology inspired by [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), but focused on documentation. Its goal is to bring the same principles that make software delivery fast and reliable into the documentation process: collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. 

In other words, we‚Äôre basically borrowing the cool kids‚Äô playbook (the developers) and writing our own version, but with fewer deploys at midnight and more debates about comma placement.

The core principles of DocOps are:

- Collaboration: Docs are created and maintained by cross-functional teams (developers, writers, support, etc.)  
- Automation: Tools like CI/CD pipelines, static site generators, and version control automate doc updates, publishing, and testing.  
- Integration: Docs are treated as part of the product lifecycle, not an afterthought, they‚Äôre versioned, reviewed, and deployed alongside code.  
- User-centricity: Docs are continuously improved based on user feedback and analytics.

Because of its close relationship to DevOps, DocOps typically relies on a Docs-as-Code approach. It automates publishing, testing, and deployment through continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

Practicing DocOps means getting comfortable with version control, markup languages, scripting, static site generators, Docker containers, and linters. The person who keeps this chaos functional is often called a documentation engineer (or docs engineer for short).

In short:  
DocOps is to documentation what DevOps is to software delivery (but with less Python and more Markdown).

## Why DocOps matters

DocOps helps teams ship documentation as quickly and reliably as they ship code. It reduces manual work, keeps docs in sync with fast-moving products, and prevents the dreaded ‚Äúoutdated since last quarter‚Äù problem.

For growing engineering organizations, DocOps often becomes the only scalable way to maintain accurate, high-quality documentation that doesn‚Äôt depend on a single overworked writer with 20 browser tabs open and a prayer.

Personally, this is what drew me to DocOps, the promise of connecting technical precision with the same care and structure that good writing demands. (Also, I thought automating things would make me look cool.) 

It‚Äôs not just about tools and pipelines, it‚Äôs about building sustainable systems for knowledge that can grow and adapt over time.


## What is a documentation engineer?

A documentation engineer is a technical professional who applies software engineering principles to documentation systems, workflows, and tools. Rather than focusing primarily on writing content (as a technical writer does), documentation engineers focus on building and maintaining the infrastructure that makes documentation scalable, automatable, and integrated with the product lifecycle.

### Typical responsibilities

- Automation: Set up pipelines for building and publishing docs (e.g., using CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI). Bonus points if it works on the first try (it won‚Äôt) 
- Tooling: Develop or customize static site generators (e.g., Docusaurus, Hugo, MkDocs, Sphinx).  
- Integration: Connect docs with codebases, APIs, SDKs, or product UIs so that docs update automatically. Or at least "less manual than before." 
- Content delivery: Implement search, localization, and versioning systems. 
- Data and metrics: Collect analytics on documentation usage and performance. Then quietly question your life choices when analytics show that everyone ignores your ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù guide.  
- Docs as code: Maintain repositories and ensure docs follow code-like workflows (linting, testing, reviews).

In short, a documentation engineer bridges the gap between technical writing and software development, making documentation more reliable, maintainable, and developer-friendly.

## DocOps in action

Imagine a SaaS platform that automatically generates and publishes API documentation whenever new endpoints are deployed. A documentation engineer maintains the automation pipeline that pulls data from OpenAPI specs, runs quality checks (like link testing and linting), and triggers a build once the code is merged.

This is DocOps in practice: a seamless integration of docs into the product development cycle; the kind of magic that only breaks right before a release. ü™Ñ

## From technical writer to documentation engineer

As a technical writer, I‚Äôve always seen documentation as a living system, not just a collection of pages, but a network of knowledge that grows with the product.  

That perspective aligns naturally with DocOps thinking. Technical writers already design information systems: we map user journeys, structure content for clarity, and obssess on accessibility and usability. When we start mastering the technical side (version control, CI/CD pipelines, static site generators, linters, documentation testing) we extend that same systemic thinking to how docs are built and maintained.

Becoming a documentation engineer isn‚Äôt about leaving writing behind. It‚Äôs about expanding your influence from crafting words to engineering the frameworks and architectures that sustain those words at scale. Eventually, you realize you‚Äôre spending less time editing sentences and more time debugging build logs at 2 a.m. üë©‚Äçüíª

Somewhere along the way, you evolve from ‚Äúwordsmith‚Äù to ‚Äúaccidental DevOps intern." You still get to complain about Oxford, but now you do it while configuring Docker. Congratulations.üéâ

## The information architecture connection

Information architecture (IA) is the bridge between writing and engineering. It gives structure and purpose to DocOps by ensuring that automation serves the user, not just the system.

Writers bring a unique strength here: we understand how users think, search, and learn. When we apply that insight to DocOps, we make sure that the automation we build results in documentation that‚Äôs findable, coherent, and genuinely useful.

That‚Äôs the advantage writers have when we step into DocOps; we don‚Äôt just build pipelines, we build pathways for understanding. And yes, sometimes those pathways include three redirects and a missing sidebar, but it‚Äôs fine. Totally fine.

Still, beneath the chaos, that‚Äôs what makes DocOps exciting, it‚Äôs a living, evolving practice.

## Conclusion

DocOps and documentation engineering redefine how we build, scale, and sustain technical documentation.  

They represent a shift from writing docs to engineering documentation systems, treating content as code and user experience as infrastructure. For technical writers, this evolution opens a new frontier: from crafting content to designing the systems that make documentation possible.  

For me, learning DocOps is about building that bridge: between clarity and code, between information architecture and automation.  

It‚Äôs weirdly empowering, in the same way that finally fixing your own CSS bug is empowering: you don‚Äôt know how you did it, but you‚Äôre going to brag about it anyway.

Because the future of documentation isn‚Äôt just written, **it‚Äôs engineered.**
