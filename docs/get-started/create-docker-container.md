# Create your first Docker container

Docker makes it easy to package your application with everything it needs to run no matter where itâ€™s deployed.
The goals of this tutorial are the followingL

1. To build, name, and version your first Docker container.
2. To understand the basic concepts behing Docker containers.

## Why use Docker?

Docker is a software platform that simplifies the process of building, sharing, and running applications. It allows developers to package an application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Docker isolates your application and its dependencies from your host system. This means that you can develop and test in a consistent environment that behaves exactly the same on any machine.

Instead of manually installing tools or libraries, you define everything inside a Docker image, which is a portable, self contained environment.

    In the context of technology and software development, "to package" means to bundle an application's code, all its dependencies, configuration files, and necessary resources into a single, standardized, and easily distributable unit. ðŸ“¦
    
    This process is essentially preparing the software for its final journey to the user or server where it will run.

## Key concepts: images vs containers

In Docker, images and containers are close concepts but they serve different purposes. Below is a tale that summarizes the key differences:

| Concept      | Description                          |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Image       | A read-only template containing your application, libraries, and dependencies.|
| Container   | A runnable instance of an image. Docker adds a writable layer on top so you can modify it while it runs.|

Each container you start is based on an image, but containers are temporary; images are the reusable blueprint.

## Understanding Docker image names

A full Docker image name follows this structure:

``` 
REGISTRY/NAMESPACE/REPOSITORY:TAG
```

| Component    | Example     | Description    |
| :----------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Registry      | `docker.io` | Where the image is stored (Docker Hub by default). |
| Namespace/User    |`johndoe`  | Your Docker Hub username or organization.  |
| Repository        | `myapp`   | The name of your project or image.    |
| Image tag               | `v1.0.01`  | Identifies the version or environment (e.g., latest, dev, prod). |

Example:
``` title="bubble_sort.py"
docker.io/janedoe/myapp:v1.0.0
```
When you omit the registry or tag, Docker assumes `docker.io` and `:latest`.

## Create your first Docker container

Letâ€™s start a simple container using an existing image from Docker Hub.

``` 
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-welcome-app docker/welcome-to-docker
```
What this command does:
	â€¢	-d â†’ Runs the container in the background (detached mode).
	â€¢	-p 8080:80 â†’ Maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on your computer.
	â€¢	--name my-welcome-app â†’ Assigns a friendly name to the container.
	â€¢	docker/welcome-to-docker â†’ The image to run.

Now open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080 â€” you should see Dockerâ€™s welcome page!

## Build and tag your image

After your container is running, you can capture its state as a new image.
For example, if you made changes inside the container, use:

``` 
docker commit my-welcome-app janedoe/myapp:v1.0.0
```
This command:
	1.	Creates a new, immutable image layer from the containerâ€™s current state.
	2.	Assigns the tag v1.0.0 to that new image.

You can now reuse, share, or deploy this image anywhere.

## Version your Docker image

Tags let you organize and track different image versions.
Use semantic versioning to clearly label builds and stages of your workflow:

| Tag | Purpose |
|:---- | :---- |
| `:dev` | Development environment (local testing.) |
| `:staging` | Pre-production testing.|
| `:prod` | Production-ready image. |
| `:v1.0.0`, `:v1.0.1` | Specific, versioned releases.| 

Using explicit tags prevents confusion and allows instant rollback.
For example, if a new deployment fails, you can quickly revert to the previous version:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 janedoe/myapp:v1.0.0
```

???+ tip
    Avoid the `:latest` tag for production as it can be overwritten easily.
